This set of files belongs to a working paper I wrote with a professor while taking his observational studies class. The data set for this paper comes from the Behavioral Health Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). This is a survey that is conducted by the CDC where the goal is to collect information about the US population about their health behaviors, for example: "Do you smoke?" or "Do you exercise?". An example of a question can be seen below.
